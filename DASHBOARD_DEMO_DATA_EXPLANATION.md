# ORION Dashboard - Demo Data & Parameter Explanations

## Overview
The ORION Dashboard provides real-time visibility into the entire supply chain orchestration system, displaying key performance indicators (KPIs), system anomalies, and recent workflow activities.

---

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### 1. **Pending Production** 
**Current Value:** 247 orders  
**Trend:** +12%

**What it means:**
- Number of production orders that are currently in the workflow pipeline
- Includes orders in the following states:
  - `PROPOSAL`: Generated by the system, awaiting supplier input
  - `PENDING_APPROVAL`: Supplier has submitted Trigger Qty and FRI Date, awaiting Ops validation
  - Not yet in `CONFIRMED_RPO` status

**Business Impact:**
- High numbers indicate active production planning
- Sudden spikes may indicate seasonal demand or new product launches
- Declining trends suggest production completion or workflow bottlenecks

**Related Workflow:** Step 1.4 - Production Hub

---

### 2. **Shipment Negotiations**
**Current Value:** 18 active negotiations  
**Trend:** Active

**What it means:**
- Number of shipment proposals currently in the negotiation phase between Supplier and Ops
- Includes shipments with status:
  - `RELEASED_TO_SUPPLIER`: Ops has released proposal to supplier for review
  - `MOD_REQUESTED`: Supplier has requested modifications (PBSUP action)
  - Awaiting either OKSUP (Accept) or Ops validation

**Business Impact:**
- Indicates collaborative decision-making in progress
- High numbers may suggest:
  - Capacity constraints requiring ETD adjustments
  - Quantity mismatches between forecast and actual production
  - Port/routing optimization discussions
- Low numbers indicate smooth alignment between parties

**Related Workflow:** Steps 1.6.3 - 1.6.4 (Shipment Negotiation)

---

### 3. **Container Utilization**
**Current Value:** 87%  
**Trend:** Optimal

**What it means:**
- Average percentage of container space being utilized across all active shipments
- Calculated as: (Actual CBM / Maximum Container CBM) × 100
- Industry benchmark: 75-85% is considered optimal

**Business Impact:**
- **85-95%:** Optimal - Maximizing shipping efficiency without overpacking
- **70-85%:** Acceptable - Room for consolidation improvements
- **Below 70%:** Suboptimal - Wasting shipping costs, consider consolidation
- **Above 95%:** Risk of damage, customs issues, or rejected containers

**Cost Implications:**
- Every 10% improvement in utilization can reduce shipping costs by 5-8%
- Example: At 87% vs 70%, you're saving approximately $1,200 per 40ft container

**Related Workflow:** Step 1.6.1 - Shipment Creation (Grouping Logic)

---

### 4. **System Alerts**
**Current Value:** 6 active alerts  
**Trend:** Critical

**What it means:**
- Number of anomalies, exceptions, or critical issues detected by the ORION system
- Alerts are categorized by severity:
  - **Danger (Red):** Requires immediate action (e.g., ETD < 48hrs, over-production)
  - **Warning (Amber):** Needs attention but not urgent (e.g., inventory low, EDI pending)

**Business Impact:**
- Proactive issue detection prevents downstream problems
- Alerts trigger automated notifications to relevant stakeholders
- Unresolved alerts can cascade into delays, stockouts, or excess inventory

**Related Workflow:** All steps - System-wide monitoring
