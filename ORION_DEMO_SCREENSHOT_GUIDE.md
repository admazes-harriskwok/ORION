# ORION Screenshot & Media Capture Guide

This guide provides specific recommendations for capturing the most impactful User Interface (UI) states for your ORION presentation. A great demo combines wide-angle shots for context and close-ups for "hero" details.

## 📸 Capture Preparation Tips
- **Resolution**: Capture at **1920x1080** for a standard slide deck.
- **Browser**: Use Chrome/Edge. Hide bookmarks bar (`Ctrl+Shift+B`) and use Full Screen mode (`F11`).
- **Clean Data**: Ensure no "test" or "asdf" data is visible. Use the "Reset Demo Data" feature if available.
- **Role Toggle**: Always start in **Ops Manager** role unless specified.

## 🎬 Video/GIF Recording Suggestions

If your presentation tool supports video or GIFs, capture these 3 high-impact interactions:

1. **The Registration Sync** (3 seconds): Click "Register All" → Watch badges turn green instantly.
2. **The "Wow" Moment** (12 seconds): Click "Batch Confirmation" → Watch the banner appear → Scroll down as 600 rows turn green one by one.
3. **The Role Swap**: Clicking the toggle and seeing the table structure shift seamlessly.
